# A Posthuman or Transhuman artist (Victoria Modesta)

I consider Victoria Modesta to be a Transhuman artist. She creates art with her limbs after amputation and confidently modifies her own limbs. Finally allowing yourself to surpass your former self even more, both physically and spiritually. In music-video, she is at odds with society and is in great conflict with conventional thinking. Most people could not accept her, and many were filled with fear and hatred for her. The fear is that she will shake the whole system with her personal influence and overturn the original dogmatism so completely that it will be impossible to limit individual thought. I think she focuses not on integration with the general environment, but on challenging conventional views and traditional power structures and working to transcend the limits of the human body and spirit through technology. What she wants is not a generally subjective agenda, but an eagerness to break down these traditionally unequal agendas and to radically transform them by raising self-awareness and social influence through technology. This enables equality for all, the elimination of innate intellectual disabilities and physical handicaps, and the improvement of the conditions of human existence.
