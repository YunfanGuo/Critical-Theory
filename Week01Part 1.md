AI Painting
1. Catalogue of the University of the Arts London library

In my university library's online catalog on [AI Painting], there were only five less relevant records (as in Figure 1.1). To find useful records, I found that it was because the keywords were not accurate enough to search well for AI. so I changed the search criteria. A search for [Artificial Intelligence Painting] produced two books, both matching the search criteria (one from 1996 and one from 2008, as in Figure 1.2). The search for AI was not good here because it is not a phrase with a specific meaning; it can be an abbreviation for many words, and it would be much better to change it to a specific phrase here.

2. Google books

A search for [Artificial Intelligence Painting] in Google Books produced several hundred search results (as in Figure 2.1). There were too many search results and the search needed to be narrowed down. I put the search term in double quotes and selected the time as the 21st century. I ended up with 9 search results, which was a suitable range, and found a selection with a lot of relevance (as in Figure 2.2). Putting inverted commas here allows the search terms to be turned into phrases rather than separate keywords for the search and the results can be more effective.

3. Google scholar
A search for [Artificial Intelligence painting] in Google scholar produced 204,000 results (as in Figure 3.1). When searching for ["artificial intelligence paintings"] produced 88 results (as in Figure 3.2). Setting the time again to 2000-2023 reduced the results to 77 (as in Figure 3.3).

4. Web of Knowledge

A search for [Artificial Intelligence painting] on WoK produced 134 results (as in Figure 4.1). However, a search for [AI painting] produced 19 results (as in Figure 4.2). But it was still not accurate enough, and the information obtained was still not sufficient. So I switched to other searches with similar information. For example [AI drawing], the search yielded 34 results (as in Figure 4.3). So if the results are not sufficient, you can choose other relevant search terms to search for.

In summary, if there are too few search results, expand the search, if there are too many, narrow it down by different criteria.
