# Coding literacy

Veeâ€™s coding literacy 

Programming is writing because it is symbols inscribed on a surface and designed to be read. But programming is also not writing, or rather, it is something more than writing. (p. 20)

I agree with this statement. There is a lot in common between programming and writing. Writing is a form of organising ideas by using a language and then writing them down. Programming is also a form of expressing ideas by using an assembly language to compose a piece of writing. They both express ideas through the use of a language that can be presented and read. The difference is that writing uses natural human language, while programming uses assembly language that can be understood by computers. Both languages also have their own specific syntax. Writing organises the vocabulary of a language around the central idea to be expressed in a text, while programming organises the code of instructions around the functional idea to be achieved using its own syntax.

However, the computer only understands yes or no, and the different assembly languages are also created by humans through "zeros" and "ones", making it easier for humans to learn and for humans and machines to communicate more easily. Man expresses ideas by communicating with machines, thus making it easier to write. But programming is more than just writing, in the sense that programming is more direct than writing, and allows for better and more timely feedback. Programming gives something that is more integrated into a person's mind and life. It is possible to create things that operate like ideologies, that are invisible and imperceptible in life, thus making the experience of programming more natural than writing. And now that the medium is no longer monolithic, with multimedia and interactive electronic devices becoming increasingly important communication tools, programming can express one's goals and wishes in a variety of ways in the shortest possible time, so what programming can bring can also be more valuable than writing.
