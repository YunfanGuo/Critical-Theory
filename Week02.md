# Designer-Maker-User

I am very happy to have visited the Design Museum, which has given me a wealth of both ideas and knowledge. I have been to this museum several times before and after, but this visit to the Designer-Maker-User with a different perspective made me realize a lot. The exhibition gives visitors a very comprehensive impression of the exhibition from the perspective of designers, makers, and users, including the crowdsourcing wall. The exhibition also encompasses a wide range of design disciplines from architecture and engineering to digital interaction.

I recognize that the exhibition is divided into several sections around the links between the three, and I have my views on this. 1. looks at how designers work, examines how changes in technology have shaped the making of products, and explores the various ways in which 'good' design has been defined. 2. brings together a range of classic works by designers and other design experts. 3. Traces the evolution of specific design categories, retrieving points in time and events that symbolize milestones in recent design history. I have been thinking a lot about the definition of 'good' and the history of the evolution of expert work and design. There has been a lot of talk about this, with different definitions at different times and points in time, and a lot of power dynamics. The position of power relations is not static, but can be reversed at any time in the struggle for conflict and strategy as the strategies, dispatches, machinations, techniques and operations of power relations change accordingly. The various 'good' defined in the exhibition, like 'Panopticism', the circular prison designed by Jeremy Bentham, where a single watcher can watch all the inmates without the inmates being able to determine whether they are being surveillance. It is most effective because the imprisoned person is aware that he or she is being observed, thus creating a conscious 'self-monitoring mechanism' that ensures that the power to discipline is constantly and automatically in play. So the uniform distribution and arrangement of power can constrain everyone's thinking. So I think it is necessary to keep learning from it and not to solidify the state of mind by doing so, preferably by abandoning the objective and neutral view of eternal truth. This power, of course, depends not only on the 'surveillance' and 'discipline' imposed on the body but also on the knowledge of the 'disciplines' that go with it. These 'disciplines' operate within the domination, domination, and interests of power over the body; it is in these that power relations encourage the production, production, and reproduction of knowledge, truth, and discourse.

The phrase that struck me most in What is Good Design is this: The only thing design is escaping from is the limit we place on our own thinking. â€”Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby
