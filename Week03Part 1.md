# Literacy and computer programming
Literacy is the ability to read and write through the use of a language. It is the most important ability needed to be able to produce interactions between people and people, and between people and things. It involves a continuous process of learning that leads to corresponding goals and participation in the wider society. But I don't think the concept is limited to spoken and written language alone. It should cover a wider range of approaches and skills, that is, the ability to understand and create messages, communications and productions, which can be in various forms. And in the twenty-first century and beyond, multimedia and interactive electronic devices are increasingly important tools of communication. And the manipulation of reading and writing through these tools requires the use of computer programming. I believe that computer programming languages are nowadays a very important language. It is through computer programming languages that people make connections with machines, and through their connections with machines that they can identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, compute and use operations. I think then that programming can be a literacy skill.
