# South London Gallery (2022 New Contemporaries)

I was delighted to be able to visit the South London Gallery. There are many wonderful works of art in the museum and I enjoyed one of them, Bosode, an artwork by Akinsola Lawanson. This work depicts a girl who is transported to the spirit world and sent on a mission. By combining traditional religious deities with binary mathematics and influenced by Nollywood horror films and early 21st-century gaming aesthetics, she reveals a contemporary Yoruba culture beyond the binary.
This artwork presents and uniquely explores this theme. It uses a video game engine and motorized sculpture to produce a final interactive film with multiple possible endings.
This unique approach allows these cultures to be brought to life and made more accessible. This one is very interesting.
For the gameplay, I wanted a more subtle integration into the video and for the interaction to be more naturally integrated into the storyline.
The greatest inspiration for me from this artwork is to create and express art in another perspective and form, which I think is very important.
Because a unique perspective brings a different feeling to a person. I think the form of this artwork is something I can study to see how the viewer can better understand the subject matter of the artwork.
